                    <p>* <b>Monkey D. Luffy</b>, commonly known as <b>"Straw Hat Luffy"</b> or simply <b>"Straw Hat"</b>, is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful <b>Straw Hat Pirates</b>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>* Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader <b>Monkey D. Dragon</b> and grandson of the Marine hero <b>Monkey D. Garp</b> and as such is a carrier of the mysterious "D" legacy. <br>* Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late <b>Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace</b> and <b>Revolutionary officer Sabo</b>. <br>* However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate <b>"Red-Haired" Shanks</b> , who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>* Luffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. <br>* He is renowned for his trademark straw hat (from which he gets his epithet <b>"Straw Hat Luffy"</b>), which was lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate captain, <b>"Red-Haired" Shanks</b>, who Sin turn received it from <b>Gol D. Roger</b>. <br>* Before the timeskip, his main outfit consisted of a red vest, light blue denim shorts cuffed just above his knees, and tan sandals. <br>* Luffy also has a scar with two stitches underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face to show Shanks that he was tough enough to be a pirate. <br>* He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit War of Marineford, leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Dream</h3>
                    <p>* Monkey D. Luffy's ultimate dream is to become the Pirate King so he can become the person with the most freedom in the world, with the ability to travel anywhere on the ocean. <br>* Luffy's dream is known to only a few people: his crew, sworn brothers <b>Ace</b> and <b>Sabo</b>, and role model <b>Shanks</b>, and indirectly <b>Yamato</b> and <b>Momonosuke</b>, and it is said to be the same original goal of <b>Gol D. Roger</b>. <br>* In order to achieve it he decides to become the <b>Pirate King</b> and gather his own pirate crew to back him up. <br>* To become the Pirate King, he must find Roger's famed treasure, One Piece, which is implied to be on Laugh Tale. <br>* As for a crew, he has brought together nine people so far who have caught his attention. <br>* Luffy is also looking to meet up with Shanks again and return his straw hat to him but will only do this after his crew has surpassed Shanks' crew in strength. <br>* This dream is the driving force behind all of Luffy's adventures in the <b>One Piece</b>.

    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>* The Thousand Sunny was first conceived by Franky when he was young. Inspired by his mentor Tom's creation, the Oro Jackson, Franky dreamed of making a ship that would sail around the world. <br>* This dream, however, was shattered when Tom was taken away, as Franky blamed himself for Tom's arrest and vowed to never build another ship ever again</p>
