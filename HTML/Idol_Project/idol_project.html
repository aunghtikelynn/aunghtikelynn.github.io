                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>* Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the <br>Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such is a carrier of the mysterious "D" legacy. <br>* Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore <br> brotherhood to the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace and Revolutionary officer Sabo. <br>* However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled <br> him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his <br> signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.</p> 
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Appearance</h3>
                    <p>* Luffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. <br>* He is renowned for his trademark straw hat (from which he gets his epithet "Straw Hat Luffy"), which was <br>  lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate captain, "Red-Haired" Shanks, who Sin turn received it <br> from Gol D. Roger. <br>* Before the timeskip, his main outfit consisted of a red vest, light blue denim shorts cuffed just above his knees, <br> and tan sandals. <br>* Luffy also has a scar with two stitches underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face <br> to show Shanks that he was tough enough to be a pirate. <br>* He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit War of Marineford, leaving a large X-shaped scar on his  <br>chest.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Dream</h3>
                    <p>* Monkey D. Luffy's ultimate dream is to become the Pirate King so he can become the person with the most <br> freedom in the world, with the ability to travel anywhere on the ocean. <br>* He aims to find the One Piece, a legendary treasure that will earn him the coveted title of Pirate King. <br>* He's confident that he can't achieve this dream alone and relies on his comrades to help him. <br>* This dream is the driving force behind all of Luffy's adventures in the One Piece.</p>
